# Landing-Page
This is my second project in the The Odin Project.In this project, I am going to use the skills I have gained from the beginning of this project which encompass creating and editing an html file, and styling it with css.

One of the skills I will utilize a lot in this project is styling an html file using flexbox. Just to mention a few, a flexbox makes it easier to shift elements around when a page is resized, allowing for a more responsive design.

Oh, and let me make a honorable mention about the images I use in this project as I do not own any of them. All the images were downloaded from pexels.com and some of the owners are Magdar Ehlers, Pixabay, etc.
